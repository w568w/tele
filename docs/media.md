# Media

What `tele` draws inline, what it plays on its own, and what it hands to an
external program. Settings for all of it live under `photos:` in
[configuration.md](configuration.md#photos).

## Photos

Rendered inline in high quality via the Kitty graphics protocol in kitty,
Ghostty and iTerm2 3.7.0 or newer, with an ANSI block-art fallback everywhere
else. tmux and screen do not pass the protocol through, so images are block art
inside them.

Press `o` to open the full-quality image in an in-app modal viewer, with sender
and timestamp on the border, or `O` to open it in an external viewer.

## Voice messages

An amplitude waveform with duration, and in-app playback on `p` with an animated
playhead.

Playback is cgo-free on every platform: Opus/Ogg is decoded in pure Go, and
audio goes out via `oto` on macOS and Windows, or the PulseAudio/PipeWire
protocol on Linux. On Linux this needs a running PulseAudio or PipeWire server,
which is the desktop default.

## Video and round video (кружки)

An inline thumbnail preview with a `▶` and duration overlay; round notes are
shown as a circle. Press `o` to play in the system player.

## GIFs

An inline static thumbnail with a `GIF` badge. The selected GIF loops silently
in place in Kitty graphics mode. This needs `ffmpeg` - see below.

## Audio (music)

Performer, title and duration. Other media types show a labelled placeholder.

## Sending media

Attach an existing file from disk with `u` - photos, videos, voice notes, music,
documents - and confirm the send-as type before sending. Press `u` again to
stage more files: they are sent as one grouped album, with photos and documents
split into separate albums automatically.

## Recording is out of scope

`tele` can _send_ a pre-recorded audio or video file, but it cannot **record**
voice messages or round videos (кружки) in-app, and it does not do real-time
voice or video calls. As a terminal-native, cgo-free client it has no microphone
or camera capture stack. This is an architectural boundary, not a missing
feature on the roadmap.

## Optional dependency: `ffmpeg`

Install `ffmpeg` (with `ffprobe`) on your `PATH` to enable inline GIF playback,
which decodes frames, and to attach duration, dimensions and a thumbnail when
sending videos. It is entirely optional: without it, GIFs stay static and videos
still send, since Telegram generates the preview server-side.
