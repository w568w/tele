# Configuration

`tele` keeps one YAML file, created on first run:

```text
~/.config/tele/config.yml
```

Pass `--config <path>` to use a different one.

## The settings overlay

Press `,` for the settings overlay: every setting `tele` has, grouped and ordered
the way the config file is, so a row you see there is found in the file at the
same path. It shows what each one is worth now, marks the ones nobody has chosen
(`[default]`), and says when a change takes hold - at once, `[next]` time `tele`
does that thing, or after a `[restart]`. Keybindings are listed there too, with
what your config changed and what it changed from.

Changes made there are written straight into `config.yml`, keeping your
comments, blank lines and anything in the file `tele` does not know about. Editing
the file in an editor and editing it in the overlay are the same act: both end
with the file being read again, so the two can never disagree. `enter` changes
the setting under the cursor, `r` puts it back to its default, and `esc` closes.

Four settings are shown but not changed there - which account this is, and where
its state lives. Changing those means moving files and reopening a session, so
they are a deliberate edit to the file rather than a keystroke.

## Proxy

`proxy` is how `tele` reaches Telegram's data centres. Every connection takes it:
messages, photos, voice notes, files, whichever data centre they come from. The
section is read at startup, so a change takes hold on `[restart]`.

`proxy.type` says which route, and it takes four values:

| `type`   | what it does                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto`   | the default: whatever `ALL_PROXY` says, direct if it says nothing |
| `direct` | no proxy, and `ALL_PROXY` is ignored                          |
| `mtproto`| an MTProto proxy - `server`, `port` and `secret`               |
| `socks5` | a SOCKS5 proxy - `server`, `port`, and `username`/`password` if it asks |

An MTProto proxy is the kind the official clients take from a `tg://proxy` or
`t.me/proxy` link, including local bridges that expose one on `127.0.0.1`. Write
the `secret` the way the proxy published it: hex or base64url, both are read, and
all three kinds work - a bare secret, a `dd` one, and an `ee` one that disguises
the connection as ordinary web traffic to the domain the secret carries.

```yaml
proxy:
  type: mtproto
  server: 127.0.0.1
  port: 1443
  secret: ee0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef6578616d706c652e636f6d
```

Copy the secret whole, without picking it apart: in hex the `ee` prefix and the
cloak domain are part of the same string (the tail above is `example.com`), and
in base64url the whole thing is one word.

A SOCKS5 proxy that asks who is calling gets `username` and `password` together;
one without the other is refused, because half a login is a connection that is
turned away with no reason given.

```yaml
proxy:
  type: socks5
  server: 10.0.0.1
  port: 1080
  username: me
  password: hunter2
```

Values belonging to another type are left alone and reported at launch - a
`secret` under `socks5` is not used, and `tele` says so rather than letting you
believe it is.

### When the proxy does not work

A proxy section `tele` cannot read stops the start, with a message naming the
key, the file it is in, and the one edit that connects without a proxy:

```text
config: proxy.secret is neither hex nor base64url; it is what a proxy publishes,
copied whole (in ~/.config/tele/config.yml; set proxy.type: direct to connect
without a proxy)
```

A proxy that nobody answers on stops the start the same way, after one dial with
a short timeout. Both happen before the interface is drawn, on purpose: every
other setting in this file is repaired to its default and reported as a warning,
but the default for a route is a direct connection to Telegram, and a typo in a
secret must not quietly send your traffic where the proxy was there to avoid
sending it.

A wrong secret or wrong credentials cannot be told apart from an unreachable
server until Telegram answers, so those surface as ordinary connection failures
once `tele` is running.

### ALL_PROXY

Before this section existed, `tele` read the `ALL_PROXY` environment variable,
and it still does when `proxy.type` is `auto`. Only `socks5://` URLs are read
from it - an `http://` proxy there is ignored, silently by everything else and
with a warning by `tele`.

The variable is deprecated and will be removed. It applies to every program
started from that shell rather than to `tele` alone, it cannot describe an
MTProto proxy, and it does not show up in the settings overlay. Move it into the
config:

```yaml
proxy:
  type: socks5
  server: 127.0.0.1
  port: 1080
```

## State directory

`state_dir` sets where the account's state lives - the Telegram session, the
local database, and the instance lock. It defaults to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tele`,
falling back to `~/.local/state/tele`.

Only one `tele` instance can use a state directory at a time. A second one exits
immediately and names the process holding it. Two instances shared one session
and one database with nothing arbitrating between them, quietly overwriting each
other's unread counts and sync state, so this is now refused rather than left to
fail quietly later.

The older `telegram.session_file` key still works and keeps the session where it
points, but it is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. If you have
not set it, your existing session and database are moved into the state directory
automatically on first run - nothing is lost and you stay logged in.

## Notifications

A new message reaches you two ways, and `ui.notifications` switches them
separately. `desktop` hands the notification to your operating system's
notification service, where it survives `tele` not being on screen and can be
routed by your own notification daemon. `toast` draws it in a corner of `tele`'s
own window, which no daemon rule can reach. Turn either off, or both.

Neither switch touches the chat list: with both off, a new message still
highlights its row and moves the chat up. That is the message arriving, not an
interruption - the same line Telegram's own mute draws.

`preview` is about what a notification says rather than where it goes, so it
applies to both: off, the desktop notification and the toast alike carry the
sender's name and nothing else. The body is rendered once and handed to each
unchanged, which is what keeps the two from ever disagreeing about the same
message.

`ui.toasts` places the toasts themselves. Errors, warnings and confirmations go
to `error_zone`; notifications go to `notify_zone`. Both take `bottom-right` or
`top-right` and may name the same corner, in which case they stack together. The
bottom-left corner is not offered: it is kept for the key-press overlay.

## Photos

`photos.mode` picks the renderer. `auto` uses the Kitty graphics protocol in the
terminals known to place images through Unicode placeholders - kitty, Ghostty,
and iTerm2 from 3.7.0 - and draws ANSI block art everywhere else, including
inside tmux and screen, which do not pass the protocol through. `kitty` and
`blocks` force one renderer for a terminal the heuristic does not know: forcing
`kitty` on one that ignores placeholder cells leaves a photo as blank space
rather than block art. The value is read once at startup.

`kitty_placement_cap` bounds how many Kitty image placements are live on the
terminal simultaneously. Only on-screen images (plus a few recently
scrolled-past) are transmitted; older ones are evicted. Transmitting an entire
heavy chat at once can exceed the terminal's image limit and corrupt placements
(shrunken or shifted photos) - lower the cap if you still see that.

`max_long_side_px` caps a rendered inline image's long side in pixels (mirrors
the desktop clients' fixed media size). The height is additionally bounded to 2/3
of the chat pane so a tall photo never dominates the view. Raise it for larger
inline images, lower it for more compact ones.

## Avatars

`avatars.disk_cache_size` is a second budget, deliberately not part of
`photos.disk_cache_size`. An avatar is around a hundred kilobytes and is asked
for again every time you open that person's profile, while chat media is
unbounded and looked at once - sharing one budget would let a scrolling session
evict every face you have. Either key set to `0` means "keep nothing between
runs": that cache moves into a temp directory and is deleted on exit.
