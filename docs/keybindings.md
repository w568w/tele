# Keybindings

## Global

| Key                       | Action          |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |

| `?`                       | Keyboard shortcuts |
| `,`                       | Settings        |

## Chat list

| Key                 | Action                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `j` / `↓`           | Next chat                  |
| `k` / `↑`           | Previous chat              |
| `G`                 | Last chat                  |
| `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+U` | Scroll half-page down / up |
| `Enter`             | Open chat                  |
| `/`                 | Search chats               |
| `P`                 | Profile of the person (private chats only) |

## Chat (normal mode)

| Key       | Action                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `j`       | Select next (newer) message    |
| `k`       | Select previous (older) message|
| `Ctrl+J` / `↓` | Scroll down               |
| `Ctrl+K` / `↑` | Scroll up                 |
| `gg`      | Scroll to top                  |
| `G`       | Scroll to bottom               |
| `i` / `a` | Compose message (insert mode)  |
| `r`       | Reply to message               |
| `t`       | React to message               |
| `e`       | Edit own message               |
| `d`       | Delete own message             |
| `f`       | Forward message to another chat|
| `u`       | Attach a file to send          |
| `x`       | Cancel staged upload / clear reply or edit |
| `s`       | Download the selected file     |
| `g`       | Jump to original (for replies) |
| `o`       | Open / view media - photo in the OS viewer, video inline (Kitty + ffmpeg) or in the system player |
| `O`       | Open the selected video in the external player |
| `p`       | Play voice message (in-app)    |
| `P`       | Profile of the selected message's author, or of the person in a private chat |
| `Space`   | Context menu                   |
| `Enter`   | Retry a failed send (when one is selected) |

A message that could not be sent stays in the chat, marked `✕` in its bottom
border; selecting it names the reason in the status bar. `Enter` queues it
again, and `Space` opens a short menu offering Retry and Discard. `x` is
unaffected - it still clears a staged reply, edit or upload, never a queued
send.

## Compose (insert mode)

| Key      | Action                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Enter`  | Send message                                      |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle send-as type for a staged attachment       |
| `Esc`    | Unfocus the composer (keeps reply / edit / attachment) |

## Chat menu (on a chat-list row, `Space`)

| Key     | Action                  |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| `r`     | Mark read               |
| `u`     | Mark unread             |
| `m`     | Mute / unmute           |
| `f`     | Add to folder           |
| `a`     | Archive / unarchive     |
| `P`     | Profile (private chats only) |
| `Esc`   | Close menu              |

## Profile overlay (`P`, or `Profile` in either context menu)

| Key     | Action                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `j`/`k` | Move between actions                        |
| `o`     | Open the chat with this person               |
| `m`     | Mute / unmute (only when a chat exists)     |
| `y`     | Copy the username                            |
| `Esc`   | Close                                       |

The overlay opens on whatever is known at once and fills in the rest when
Telegram answers. Mute is absent for someone you have never messaged: there is
no chat to mute, and a guessed state would be worse than none.

## Customizing keybindings

Override default keys in the `keybindings:` section of
`~/.config/tele/config.yml`. The generated config already lists **every action
with its current default keys**, commented out - just uncomment a line and
change the key(s). Bindings are grouped by **context**, then by **action**:

```yaml
keybindings:
  chat:
    reply: "R" # a single key
    go_top: ["g g", "gg"] # several keys for one action
  chatlist:
    confirm: "l"
```

- **Replace semantics:** the keys you list become the _only_ keys for that
  action in that context. Actions you don't mention keep their defaults.
- **Chords:** a multi-key sequence is written as space-separated key tokens -
  `"g g"` means press `g` then `g`. Tokens use the terminal key names
  (`ctrl+d`, `enter`, `esc`, `space`, `up`, ...).
- **Conflicts** (an unknown action/context, an empty key, a key reused for two
  actions, or a single key that shadows a chord) are logged as warnings on
  startup and skipped or applied last-wins; a bad section never crashes the app.

**Contexts:** `global`, `folders`, `chatlist`, `chat`, `composer`, `search`,
`context_menu`, `delete_submenu`, `chat_menu`, `folder_submenu`, `filepicker`.

> Key tokens use the terminal names: letters/digits as-is (`r`, `G`, `2`),
> modifiers like `ctrl+d`, and named keys `enter`, `esc`, `space`, `up`, `down`,
> `left`, `right`.

> **Keyboard layout:** letter bindings also fire on the **same physical key**
> under a Russian (ЙЦУКЕН) layout - e.g. `r`/Reply works whether the key types
> `r` or `к`. Bindings are still written with Latin keys; no duplication needed.
> (Only the Russian layout is mapped today.)
