# App key

`tele` reaches Telegram with an app key: an `api_id` and `api_hash` pair that
identifies the application rather than you. There is nothing to do about it -
every build carries one, and logging in works as it stands.

## When Telegram refuses the key

Builds compiled from published source - homebrew-core, the Nix flake, a BSD
port, your own `go build` - share a single key between everyone who builds
`tele` that way. Telegram can refuse a key it considers too widely shared. If it
does, `tele` says `app key blocked by Telegram` rather than claiming your
session expired.

Two ways past it. Take whichever is less trouble.

### Register a key of your own

Get one at [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) and put it in
`~/.config/tele/config.yml`. A key you supply always outranks the built-in one:

```yaml
telegram:
  api_id: 123456
  api_hash: "your api hash"
```

To bake your own key into a binary instead of reading it from the config, see
[development.md](development.md#building-with-your-own-app-key).

### Install an official build

Official builds carry a key of their own: the Homebrew tap, the install script,
apt, dnf, apk, Snap, Scoop and winget all ship binaries built by `tele`'s
release pipeline.

## Which formula is which

Homebrew can serve `tele` from two places, and they differ exactly here.
`brew install tele` from homebrew-core is built from source by Homebrew, so it
carries the shared source-build key. `brew install sorokin-vladimir/tap/tele`
ships a binary from the release pipeline, with its own key.

Once the tap is tapped, a plain `brew install tele` picks the tap's formula and
says so only in a `Warning: tele shadows homebrew/core/tele` line that is easy
to scroll past. That is why both formula names are written out in full in the
README.
