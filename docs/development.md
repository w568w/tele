# Development

## Build from source

Requires Go 1.26+.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sorokin-vladimir/tele
cd tele
go build -o tele ./cmd/tele/
```

The binary this produces carries the shared app key described in
[app-key.md](app-key.md), so it runs without you registering anything.

## Building with your own app key

To build against [a key of your own](https://my.telegram.org) instead of the
shared one, pass it in. What you supply here outranks the built-in key for that
binary, the way a key in the config outranks both:

```sh
go build \
  -ldflags "-X main.buildAPIID=YOUR_API_ID -X main.buildAPIHash=YOUR_API_HASH" \
  -o tele ./cmd/tele/
```

## Nix

A `nix develop` shell is available in the repo for local development: go,
golangci-lint, lefthook.

If you touch the flake and change `go.mod` or `go.sum`, `vendorHash` in
`flake.nix` needs regenerating too. Run `nix build`, then copy the
`got: sha256-...` hash it reports into `flake.nix`.
