// Package outbox is the durable send queue: the entries on disk, and the two

// rule is testable without a connection or a database (#193).

// maxBackoff bounds the wait between transient-failure retries. There is no

// Next returns the entry the worker should attempt, if any:
//
//	the oldest entry by Seq whose NextAttemptAt has arrived, and which has no
//	older unresolved entry in the same chat.
//
// The second clause is the whole ordering model. Only the head of each chat's
// queue is ever eligible, so FIFO within a chat holds with no extra bookkeeping,
// and a chat sitting in backoff delays nobody else.
//
// "Unresolved" is doing the work there. A failed entry is not a head: it will
// never be attempted again without a person acting on it, so a position in the
// order it can never occupy is not an order, it is a stop (#224). That holds for
// every failure and not only for a refusal — a send forbidden by the chat is as
// immovable as one Telegram would not accept. An entry waiting out a backoff is
// a head, because it is going to happen and its place in the conversation is
// still its own.
//
// The alternative was to keep the ordering absolute and render the sends behind
// a failed head as blocked rather than pending. It loses because it makes a
// person do the work to recover something the queue could simply not break, and
// because a failure nobody triages still leaves a chat that cannot be typed in.
//
// entries need not be sorted.
