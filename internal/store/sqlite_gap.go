// A gap is a range of messages the account received and this store never saw.

// messages land on the tail and the chat looks current again while the missed
// range is still missing, so nothing that compares the tail with the server can
// see it afterwards. The record survives a restart for the same reason - the
// evidence is gone by the time anyone could look for it again.
//
// One position per chat, and it is where the repair has to start from: the
// earliest open gap subsumes every later one, because closing forward from
// there passes through them all.

// Gap returns the id of the message a chat's gap opens after, and whether the
// chat has one at all.
