// MergeMessages merges a page fetched from Telegram into a chat's stored
// history. Both sides are ordered oldest first, by date and then by id, and so
// is the result.
//
// A message present on both sides is one message, and the fetched copy is the
// one kept: Telegram is the source of truth for what a message says, and a
// message edited while this client was not listening is exactly why the two
// copies can differ. Without the dedup, overlapping pages stack into a
// repeating date range instead (issue #120).
//
// The direction the page extends the history in is not a parameter: an older
// page and a page fetched to close a gap merge by the same rule, and the order
// of the result follows from the messages rather than from which call site
// asked for them.
