// present from this bit alone, so zeroing the value does not clear it.

// maxChannelDiffConcurrency caps how many getChannelDifference calls the
// updates manager keeps in flight across all channels. It replaces the pacing
// the stripped timeout used to provide, without the five-minute stalls: bursts
// stay bounded while any single gap is still closed at once.
//
// Sized against the shape of a real account. A member of a few dozen channels
// fires one call per channel at startup, and each takes roughly a second, so a
// smaller cap would show up as startup latency while a larger one buys nothing.
const maxChannelDiffConcurrency = 8

// channelDiffAPI sits between updates.Manager and the raw API and strips the
// timeout field from every updates.getChannelDifference response.
//
// Telegram attaches a timeout to a channel difference, 300 seconds for a busy
// supergroup. gotd reads it as a ban on calling getChannelDifference again for
// that channel, and while the ban holds it discards every update the channel
// receives. A pts gap that opens inside the window therefore freezes the chat
// for the rest of it, with no callback and no error: one debug line and
// nothing else. Each successful catch-up re-arms the ban, so a busy supergroup
// cycles between five minutes of silence and a burst of backlog (#266).
//
// The TL schema defines the field as "clients are supposed to refetch the
// channel difference after timeout seconds have elapsed", a polling hint for an
// idle channel rather than a bar on recovering a gap. With it gone gotd closes
// the gap on its own 500ms gap timer, the way it already does for channels
// whose difference carries no timeout at all.
//
// Only the timeout is touched. The difference itself reaches the manager
// unchanged, the too-long variant included, so the gap repair behind it still
// runs (#262).
