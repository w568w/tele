// commonDiffAPI sits between updates.Manager and the raw API and delivers the
// updates a common difference recovers, itself, before handing that difference
// back to the manager untouched.
//
// The manager feeds a recovered difference back through its own pts sequence,
// then jumps the sequence to the state the difference ends at. Anything still
// buffered behind a gap at that moment is now behind the sequence, so the next
// flush discards it as outdated. The position keeps moving forward either way,
// which is why the account looks caught up while the changes themselves were
// dropped: a message rewritten repeatedly, as a bot streaming a reply does,
// ends up frozen at whatever it said before the gap (#267).
//
// Telegram also condenses a difference: a message edited thirty times comes
// back as one edit, not thirty. So the recovered edit is the only copy of the
// final text there will ever be, and losing it loses the message.
//
// Nothing is stripped and nothing is reordered. The manager still applies the
// difference its own way and still moves its position; we deliver the same
// updates in front of it, and applying by position makes the second copy a
// no-op rather than a second arrival (ADR 0016).
//
// Upstream fix: gotd/td#1854. Delete this when it ships in a release, and the
// same for the entry it has in the workaround list.
