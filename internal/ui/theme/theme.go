// them.
//
// Tokens are independent of one another with one exception: a few carry a
// dependency, refusing to mean anything unless another token is set alongside
// them. See dependencies.
//
// Field names are the public spelling of the tokens: a theme file's keys are
// matched against them through normalize, so SurfaceOverlay is written
// surface_overlay. Renaming a field renames a key that user files depend on,
// which is why TestTokenKeys pins the whole list to a golden file.

	//
	// It depends on Text: a theme resolving to a canvas without body text is
	// refused, because a painted background under a foreground the app does not
